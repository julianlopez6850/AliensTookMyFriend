# The Game

The game is a PC / Web game.

The story behind the game is that you are an astronaut who's friend has been taken by aliens. You now have to enter an alien base to fight the aliens and rescure your friend.

The game has an orthographic top-down perspective.

The character that you play as enters several different rooms, encountering different types of aliens each time, on your way to where your friend is being held.

Beware, the aliens have differing movement speeds, patterns, attacks, etc. The first alien may seem to be an easy foe to fend off, but you will notice that the fight through the rooms becomes progressively harder as you go on, until you reach the Final Boss at the end of your journey. Finish off this boss to save your friend!

Once you win the game, you can compete against yourself or your friends by trying to compete for the best time.

# Controls

You must fight these aliens by shooting your laser gun by pointing with your mouse to aim and pressing left click to fire.
